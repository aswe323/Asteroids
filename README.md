This is an astroid game built with pygame and python3.

This was create as part of the boot.dev course for backend development.


DEV:
remember to source the enviroment and create it if needed:

create:
python3 -m venv venv

source:
source venv/bin/activate

on NIX systems pygame needs to be installed outside of pip
nix-shell -p python312Packages.pygame # tested with nix package python313


as of writing this, I am yet to dig into how to make this streamlined for development.
