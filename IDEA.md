Some ideas:
1. scoring system
    neat, but kinda boring
2. make astroids look better
    lumpy? sharp? maybe smokey?
3. Create different spaceship types:
    "mine" ship - insted of shooting you drop mines that explode in a radius
    "drill" ship - you can't move normally, insted, pressing space bar pushes you forward to hit astroids, you have a shield.
